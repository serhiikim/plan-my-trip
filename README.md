# Plan My Trip

Plan My Trip is an intelligent travel planning application that helps users create personalized travel itineraries with the help of AI. The application combines the power of Google Maps, OpenAI, and custom algorithms to suggest optimal routes, points of interest, and activities based on user preferences.

## Features

- üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Map Interface**: Visualize your trip on an interactive map with Mapbox/MapLibre GL
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Planning**: Get personalized travel recommendations using OpenAI
- üìç **Smart Location Search**: Find and add points of interest using Google Maps integration
- üìÖ **Flexible Itinerary Management**: Drag-and-drop interface for easy trip planning
- üîê **Secure Authentication**: Google OAuth integration for seamless login
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
- üîÑ **Real-time Updates**: Instant synchronization of changes across devices

## How It Works

1. **User Authentication**: Users sign in using their Google account
2. **Trip Creation**: Users start by creating a new trip and specifying basic details
3. **AI Assistance**: The system uses OpenAI to suggest activities and points of interest based on:
   - Destination
   - Travel dates
   - User preferences
   - Local events and attractions
4. **Interactive Planning**: Users can:
   - Drag and drop activities to different days
   - Add custom locations
   - Modify suggested itineraries
   - View everything on an interactive map
5. **Optimization**: The system uses Targomo's routing engine to:
   - Optimize daily routes
   - Calculate travel times
   - Suggest the best order of activities

## Architecture

The application follows a modern microservices architecture:

- **Frontend**: React-based client application
  - [Client Documentation](./client/README.md)
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express server
  - [Server Documentation](./server/README.md)
